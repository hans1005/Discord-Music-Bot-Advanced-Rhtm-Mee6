# Discord-Music-Bot-Rhtm-Mee6-


MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.8+, using the [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). Besides, if the queue becomes empty MusicBot will play through a list of existing songs with configuration. The bot features a permission system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).

## Setup
Setting up the MusicBot is relatively painless - just follow one of the [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/). After that, configure the bot to ensure its connection to Discord.

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`, but it is not included by default. Simply make a copy of `example_options.ini` and rename it to `options.ini`. See `example_options.ini` for more information about configurations.

### Commands

There are many commands that can be used with the bot. Most notably, the `play <url>` command (preceded by your command prefix) will download, process, and play a song from YouTube or a similar site. A full list of commands is available [here](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/using/commands/ "Commands").

## Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request (see the above section). If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
